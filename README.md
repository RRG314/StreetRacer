# Street Racer (Beta) — Real-World Map Racing

Street Racer is a 2D open-world driving game that turns real cities into playable race environments.

Instead of handcrafted tracks, Street Racer loads real street geometry from OpenStreetMap and lets you drive it as an arcade-style top-down racer. Cities are not “themes” they *are* the tracks themselves.

Every street, curve, bridge, and grid comes from the real world. The city becomes the course.

Current locations:
- Baltimore, Maryland  
- Hollywood, California  

This is an early **beta** build. The game is fully playable end-to-end, but still being refined. This release represents the foundation of a long-term project exploring what “real-world virtual racing” can become.

## Game Modes

- **Free Roam**  
  Explore the city freely. Drive the streets, test speed, and learn the layout.

- **Time Trial**  
  Race from your starting point to a destination on the far side of the city as fast as possible.

- **Checkpoints**  
  Collect all checkpoints placed throughout the city. Your time stops when the last one is reached.

## Vision & Direction

Street Racer is the first step toward a larger idea:  
**the real world as a race space.**

This 2D version establishes the core concept that any city can become a track. Future development will expand on this foundation:

- Additional cities and regions  
- More structured race routes based on real geography  
- Heavier city models and denser environments  
- Expanded game modes and challenges  
- A full 3D version that brings real streets into immersive space  
- Virtual-app and installable experiences for long-term play  

The goal is not just to build a racing game, but to explore what it means to *drive the world itself*.

By playing this beta, you are experiencing the beginning of that direction.
