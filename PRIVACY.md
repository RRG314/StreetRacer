# Privacy Policy (Street Racer)

Last updated: 2026-01-18

Street Racer is a web-based game. The developer does not intentionally collect personal information through the game itself.

## Data the game may process
When you play, your browser may make network requests to third-party services used to load map data and imagery. Those services may receive your IP address and standard browser request data as part of normal web operation.

Examples (depending on which map modes are enabled):
- OpenStreetMap/Overpass API for road and building geometry (read-only map query)
- Map tile servers (to display background tiles such as street/satellite imagery)

These services may log requests according to their own policies.

## What we do NOT collect
- No account creation
- No email collection
- No in-app analytics by the developer (unless explicitly added in a future version and disclosed)
- No sale of personal data

## Children’s privacy
Street Racer is not designed to collect personal data. If this changes in the future, this policy will be updated.

## Changes
This policy may be updated as the project evolves. The latest version will be maintained in this repository.

## Contact
For questions about this policy, contact the developer via the project repository.
